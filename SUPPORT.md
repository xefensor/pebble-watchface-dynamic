# Dynamic support

[Report a problem or request a change](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-watchface-dynamic/issues).
Include the Dynamic version, Pebble model/OS version, phone app version, what
you expected and the steps that reproduce the problem. For a missing reading,
include the selected plugin and the state shown in **Connection & help**.
Keep private notification text out of reports and screenshots.

## Downloads and verification

Browse the [published GitHub releases](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-watchface-dynamic/releases).
The local 0.14.0 settings candidate has its own validation record.
Download the PBW and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the source ZIP is for building or inspecting
the checked snapshot. Verify the files you downloaded with
`sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS.txt`, or download both PBW and source
and use `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt`. Existing release files remain unchanged
across documentation updates.

## Setup

Dynamic targets Pebble Time 2 (`emery`). Music and notification integration use
the Android Pebble app's plugin preview. Enable it in the phone app, select
complication slots 1 and 2, and allow the sources you want to use. Source and
permission availability depend on your Pebble app and plugins.

The clock and date work without a phone. Live readings, music and notification
activities require their sources. Music is a display; use Pebble's Music app for
playback controls. Timeline Peek is the watch's native panel.

## Plugin activities

Open **Content & priority**, enable **Show activity plugins** and install a
compatible activity provider. This switch affects plugin activities only; Music
and Notifications have their own visibility checkboxes in the same priority list.
Disabled plugin rows retain their saved positions and visibility preferences.
Dynamic prefers `activity/summary` schema 4 and adapts earlier conventions.
Timer, Music and Notifications can each be primary or secondary according to
Dynamic's Activity priority list. Notifications defaults to Off; its row and
privacy controls stay synchronized. Enable it in the list to choose app-only,
sender/title or message detail. Hiding it preserves the last privacy choice.
The section shortcuts reach Content and Connection & help; Save applies changes.
The originating watchapp owns timer state
and alarms; offline changes may be missing. Include both app versions and source
sharing status in reports.

## Notification overlap

Dynamic's optional notification activity and **additional** vibration do not replace
PebbleOS notifications. If both are enabled, PebbleOS may show or vibrate for
the same event too. Leave Dynamic's vibration Off when you want only the
normal system alert. Dynamic's app filter does not change PebbleOS forwarding.

## Release status

This is a sideloaded preview. Public Pebble store submission is held while
Pebble's published plugin-preview restriction applies. See the
[publication kit](store/README.md) and [validation record](docs/VALIDATION.md)
for the exact build's checks and remaining device-test limits.
