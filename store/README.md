# Dynamic 1.0.1 — current Store preparation

The active listing is `listing.json`. Descriptions and release notes are plain
text; native screenshots and banner filenames are listed per platform. Upload
standalone native PNGs as screenshots and the 720×320 family PNG as each platform’s
banner. SVGs, product marks, provenance and licence files are editable/review
material, not extra screenshots.

The raw native screenshots are unframed and retain their original pixels. Time 2 is 200×228; Round 2 is 260×260.

The approved tactile family uses cool silver, graphite, blue controls and Fira
text outlines. Banners composite unchanged native captures with the official Core
Devices frames. Standalone screenshots remain unframed. Artwork/font/frame credits
are in `ARTWORK-LICENSES.txt`; native app UI, UUID and version are unchanged.

Prepare/check a kit with `python3 scripts/store-kit.py --pbw /path/to/checked.pbw`
and the same command with `--check`. Outputs stay under ignored `build/store/`.
The current artwork-only review is `Watch/XOCE-Identity-2026-11-14/`.
The previous full review `Watch/Store-Update-2026-11-14/` remains unchanged.
Keep old `dist/`, `releases/` and prior review bundles unchanged.

This preparation does not upload, publish or deploy anything. Existing review
acceptance is retained; emulator/browser checks do not establish physical phone
or watch testing. Verify the Dashboard listing/ownership and exact public
release bytes before activating website installation links.
