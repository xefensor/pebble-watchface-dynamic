# Dynamic maintainer notes

Dynamic targets Pebble Time 2 (`emery`, 200×228). Preserve its UUID and all
existing AppMessage key numbers. Append new keys; never reuse retired ones.

## Product intent

- ACT3 activities use the agreed notification-style composition: primary content
  above contextual footer, secondary above primary in exactly one static row.
  The footer ends at y216. Media has title plus optional 40px cover/artist footer;
  other activities use instance context, falling back to provider identity.
- Keep the complete primary block bottom-aligned directly above its footer,
  with an 8px gap when a footer is present. Move standard value labels, headline,
  detail and range indicator together. Media title ink ends above the cover/artist
  footer. Spare space stays above the block; the secondary keeps its own position.
- Any source can occupy either role. The primary expands when secondary is
  absent. Compact reduction keeps its selected clock/value structured and full;
  an essential value that cannot fit causes the optional secondary to yield.
  Both datums and media artwork remain available for local promotion.
- Text always starts at its beginning and truncates at the last visible line.
  Do not scroll, marquee, automatically page or cycle text. Do not restore old
  title continuation timers, identity headers or Last reported UI.
- Preserve immutable source/run identity, independent clocks and original
  observation/validity. Timer's known native adapter may display a bounded public
  deadline prediction without renewing its observation. Other unconfirmed legacy
  sources are omitted when their required provenance cannot be displayed.
- Media presentation, identity symbols, compact selector, semantic directions and
  media-item visual token are explicit ACT3 fields. Do not infer styling from a
  private label marker. Legacy source adaptation belongs on the phone.
- Media and Notifications use the shared activity renderer. Keep one bounded
  render plan and no parallel native Music or notification renderer.
  Incoming-only 280ms transitions follow run
  replacement or media item changes; ticks, lease refresh and artist/art arrivals
  do not start them. Activity clock ticks dirty only the activity layer.
- Two shared Pebble readings keep their positions. Timeline Peek uses the OS
  panel. Notifications is an ordinary activity in the same priority/show-hide
  list; it defaults to Off and a saved position wins over the initial first
  position. Sender/body privacy never chooses a separate layout or route.
  Keep the original baseline/privacy policy and bounded eight-second event
  window, capped by source expiry. It does not replace OS notifications.
- Activity presentation status confirms actual visible original record indices,
  native session and view/presentation sequences. A small 30-second status refresh
  maintains the routing lease; clock ticks never write storage or send messages.
- The bundled read-only navigation source exposes one recent route record for
  Open Activity. Persist only two destination app UUIDs and session/expiry data,
  never provider/run IDs, titles, notification text, artwork or content hashes.
  Validity is capped at 45 seconds and source/role expiry; reads never renew it.
- Dynamic requests summary display fields and `open_app`, excluding separate
  `actions` and `entity_ref` descriptors. Interactive hosts may request those
  capabilities later; this watchface never invokes provider actions.
- Open Activity means Dynamic's recent Primary/Secondary from any watchface;
  stock SDK cannot prove the immediately preceding face. No firmware/mobile-app
  fork, custom mobile build, Dashboard implementation or global Quick Launch
  remapping is required. Automatic app opening uses the separate helper repo.
- Phone settings colours are independent of watch colours. Preview controls
  must not silently change saved appearance or notification privacy.

## Source boundaries

- The canonical GitHub repository is `xefensor/pebble-watchface-dynamic`.
  Keep the npm name `dynamic-watchface` and dependency package/import names
  unchanged. SDK development PBWs use the checkout directory's name; release
  packaging and preview tools must work in the renamed checkout. See
  `docs/REPOSITORY-MIGRATION.md` for the repository/package mapping.
- `src/c/`: Dynamic's renderer, SDK lifecycle and host presentation.
- `src/pkjs/`: bundled/legacy Clay settings, translations and phone host integration.
- `vendor/CORE.json` and `vendor/ACTIVITIES.json`: exact pinned
  library archive/commit/checksum.
  Change the upstream core repository first, then rebuild and pin its tarball.
- `scripts/release_licenses.py`: exact notices carried in each standalone PBW.
- `.github/release.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` and
  `scripts/github-release.py`: independent GitHub release configuration,
  validation and publication. Shared helper changes should remain aligned with
  Halftone, Core and ČHMÚ; project configuration and release identity stay separate.
- `docs/VALIDATION.md`, `docs/asset-provenance.json`, `docs/qa/`: release-specific
  evidence. Preserve older evidence as historical; do not relabel it as new.
- Native activity decoding uses `pebble-activity-view.h` and `Pav*` only. Keep
  legacy provider adaptation on the phone; do not link a second ACT1 decoder
  into the limited native image. Reuse the bounded activity plan for drawing
  and clock scheduling; do not copy complete cards per frame.

## Checks and release order

1. `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm test` run portable JS/C checks. Release
   automation has separate tests:
   `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_github_release.py`.
2. `pebble build` uses the pinned font sources and generated metrics. Inspect
   native load-image size after native edits and keep it below the
   SDK's 65,535-byte limit. Heap availability is a separate measurement.
3. `python3 scripts/package-release.py` packages exact SDK payloads and notices.
4. `python3 scripts/check-native-style.py --pbw dist/Dynamic-VERSION.pbw`
   checks bundle/source/font/core/license identity. Its Python font dependencies
   are pinned in `scripts/requirements-font-assets.txt`.
5. Capture affected native states and actual Clay pages. Reuse unchanged prior
   tests; repeat only what changes or an unresolved concern requires. Never
   treat emulator/fixture results as live-phone or physical-watch verification.
6. Refresh native preview assets, rebuild, and verify the final binary/resources
   match the captured renderer. Save final image/provenance evidence.
7. For a new, unpublished version, run `python3 scripts/prepare-store.py` and
   its `--check` mode after final provenance, then
   `python3 scripts/package-source.py` last. Any source/docs edit to that
   unpublished snapshot requires regenerating its archive/checksums.
8. Commit the bumped version, checked artifacts/checksums and notes locally,
   then run
   `python3 scripts/github-release.py prepare --output /tmp/dynamic-release`.
   It validates committed `HEAD`, not uncommitted working files. Push that commit
   to `main` after the check. The workflow validates the pushed commit and
   publishes exact artifacts without an SDK rebuild. If a GitHub connector
   creates/publishes the commit directly, rely on its CI check or fetch/check out
   that commit before a local `prepare`; an old-HEAD run does not validate it.
   Use the manual Run workflow control for an identical-version retry.

## Published release immutability

- Keep published assets and tags unchanged. Later README/docs/AGENTS or
  release-automation improvements on `main` do not require rewriting an older
  source archive or republishing its version.
- The bootstrap in `.github/release.json` ties published v0.16.2 artifacts to
  tested commit `48a5aaec1aac4e2805bad2bb7e793b5da58b5165`.
  Do not repoint it to a documentation commit. A later
  version uses its own artifact commit; refresh the finite filenames/checksums.
- Published-byte changes need a new version. The workflow refuses changed or
  incomplete published assets, conflicting tags and RC/beta promotion to stable.
- Source ZIPs exclude generated `build/`, dependency, Git and `.pebble/` folders,
  generated `docs/qa/**/*.png` copies, and all PBW binaries. QA PNGs remain
  versioned in Git; buildable embedded previews and product screenshots stay in
  the source ZIP. Committed source recipes are allowed; archive path
  and runtime/build-input checks still apply.
- This repository pins Core 0.5.1 and Activities 0.4.4 explicitly. Upstream
  releases do not automatically repin or rebuild the watchface.
- Version 0.9.0 is a published GitHub development prerelease. Keep its tested
  artifacts, tag and the earlier 0.8.0 download links/bytes available.
  Prior user success on 0.8.0 is useful history, not a physical 0.9.0 check.
- Version 0.9.1 is a GitHub development prerelease. Preserve published 0.9.0
  artifacts and their original source snapshot while validating the new bytes.

- Version 0.10.0 adds identified primary/secondary cards and Dynamic-local
  provider preferences. Preserve 0.9.1 and earlier published artifacts/tags.
  Phone preferences never become new native message keys or private-content cache.

`store/listing.json` is a local publication record, not a Pebble CLI schema.
GitHub builds remain prereleases. The current official
[plugin-preview guide](https://developer.repebble.com/guides/plugins/preview/)
holds appstore submission. Recheck
the linked official rule before changing that status; preparing a consistent
store kit does not publish the app or remove the restriction.

Version 0.12.0 adds the independently callable navigation plugin. Distribution
packaging must include plugin.js, its manifest source declaration and exact
source identity, alongside the unchanged SDK native/JS payloads and licences.
Append ACTIVITY_PRESENTED/REQUEST_PRESENTATION after all existing message keys.
Native screenshots prove rendering only; real-phone app switching, permissions,
physical-watch latency and battery remain separate checks.

Version 0.13.0 removes the native notification panel. Notifications use ACT3
record indices and the normal app-destination mapping in both roles, including
body-free summaries. Presentation flags are zero; reject the retired special
notification flag. The 13-byte context-effects sidecar carries only native
session, event counter, flags and original expiry for optional vibration.

Version 0.14.0 changes phone settings only. Keep Appearance, Content & priority
and Connection & help with nonsticky focus/scroll shortcuts that do not change
browser history. The activity list owns Music/Notifications visibility; the
three notification detail choices retain their saved privacy state while hidden.
SHOW_ACTIVITIES affects generic plugins only; disabled rows explain that state
without rewriting saved order/visibility. Preserve all preference keys and default
privacy. Reused 0.13 native activity captures must retain their historical origin;
20 fresh 0.14 native previews and current Clay source hashes are separate evidence.

Version 0.15.0 adds a one-pixel divider at y114 only while a secondary row is
actually visible. Paused state follows the existing 17-language native table
and precedes optional labels/context in both roles. A compact structured value
and paused state must fit together or the optional row yields; presentation
confirmation must describe the resulting visible roles. Keep the primary/footer
anchors, one static row and original lifecycle/leases unchanged.

Phone preview includes Timer+Music, giving six sample states and 24 native
state/format/theme captures. Share colours is disclosed on demand. Preview tabs
support Home/End and wrapping arrows. The Save bar reserves its measured height;
short layout or visual viewports put it into document flow. Use visualViewport
bounds when available to keep focused inputs/selects visible. Native and phone
pixels are fresh 0.15 evidence; older evidence remains historical.

Version 0.16.0 reuses one activity plan, keyed by record/session invalidation,
language, connection, all candidate clock seconds and earliest datum/source
expiry. Hidden clocks still invalidate fitting on a host redraw. The cache's
drawn flag means an actual stable paint, not merely a prepared or sliding plan.
Preserve fresh native confirmation and final Peek geometry synchronization.
Core 0.5.1 validates complete legacy context but Dynamic retains only
WfcPhoneStatus; never restore a parallel private context allocation. Activities
0.4.2 provides the host entry without unused publisher code.
Release PBWs contain minified JavaScript and no external source maps. SDK output
stays original; the separate debug ZIP retains original SDK inputs, exact chained
maps and minifier identity. Pin Terser 5.46.0, preserve serialized Clay function
boundaries (compression/property mangling remain disabled), and independently
recompute code/maps in artifact and committed-release checks.
Generated minifier identifiers must exclude `$` in every position: Clay inserts
customFn.toString through String.replace replacement-string semantics. Keep the
actual stock-Clay generation regression and actual packaged browser execution;
source-only page tests cannot establish serialized/minified compatibility.

Version 0.16.1 pins Activities 0.4.3 and keeps Core 0.5.1. Covered native views
still validate and expire source data, but do not schedule decorative motion,
activity ticks, presentation heartbeats or host paint invalidations. The OS may
still request a background draw. Such a draw cannot confirm or withdraw the
recent navigation hint; its original source and 45-second bounds remain.
Focus return reconciles identity/expiry/clock/palette before one fresh visible
paint without replaying motion. Static minute updates dirty the background only
unless the activity plan or geometry is stale. A failed motion-timer allocation
settles the final composition immediately.
Bootstrap generations own their retry timer and content-free transport tickets.
Native baseline receipt invalidates active retries and already queued bootstrap
queries without changing other FIFO traffic. Preserve the matching ticket when
the shared queue copies a payload; it must never become a native message field.
`tests/test_native_lifecycle.py` compiles actual production callbacks against a
counted fake SDK; this is work/lifecycle evidence, not watch battery measurement.

Version 0.16.2 preserves explicit paused media state through Activities 0.4.4.
Primary media puts the localized state first in its existing cover/artist footer;
secondary media keeps the same single static row. Do not infer completion or
new labels from stopped/buffering/unknown playback. Playback-only updates keep
the original media item token and must not replay incoming-track motion. An
expired or absent artist cannot hide Paused or reintroduce stale context.
The footer uses existing ActivityPlan scratch; no new retained source data or
timer is needed. Keep standard activities with a media icon in their declared
standard presentation, including independent clocks in either role.

## Shared UI/UX implementation — local 0.17.0

Read [the implementation handoff](docs/UX-ALIGNMENT.md) and the canonical local
XOCE standard before UI work. The 0.17.0 local candidate implements the shared
phone presentation and confirmed Save-and-stay; published 0.16.2 stays frozen.
The declared `config.html` is generated by `scripts/generate-config.cjs` from
the existing Clay layout. It must not display editable defaults before a saved
snapshot loads. Preserve 17-language coverage and the legacy close-URL fallback.

`src/common/settings-state.js` validates one atomic snapshot in `clay-settings`,
including only stable activity preferences under `__dynamicActivityPreferences`.
Read the older separate key without rewriting it on open. Active PKJS owns live
writes; recheck targets after a plugin acknowledgement and synchronize a newly
started runtime before confirming Save. Wrong/late/unconfirmed acknowledgements
never discard the draft. Phone persistence is separate from watch delivery.

Keep Discard local to the last confirmed form; it must not write or promise to
undo an uncertain request. Retain browser anchoring when controls change height,
and never focus a text field while removing a filter. Preserve exact old RGB
values until their own picker changes. The native watchface layout is unchanged.
After new native captures, use an incremental SDK build and package-release to
rebundle previews without changing the captured native payload; a clean SDK
rebuild requires new native provenance. Run the exact package/font audit and
both settings browser checks, including the actual archived config/plugin/PKJS.

## Unpublished 0.18.0 design branch

`design/pebble-native-redesign` is an aesthetic trial for review. Read
[REDESIGN.md](docs/REDESIGN.md) and the updated handoff before changing it. Native
Gothic utility/date roles, stronger semantic icons and a 3px incoming settle are
deliberate; Fredoka, fixed activity geometry, exact activity-body metrics and all
data/lifecycle contracts remain. Preserve 0.17.0 artifacts, store kit and evidence.
Fresh native/package checks pass; Chromium exits 133 with crashpad EPERM, so
fresh browser/device verification is still pending. Do not present historical
0.17.0 browser results as checks of this trial. Do not publish this branch.
