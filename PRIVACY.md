# Dynamic privacy

Dynamic displays readings supplied by Pebble and the plugins you select. It
has no analytics, advertising, account service or separate weather server.

## Data used

- The first two Pebble complication choices provide the readings on the face.
  Their providers may use a network service or location according to their own
  settings and permissions. Dynamic has no direct weather HTTP client.
- Compatible activity plugins provide content, optional detail/image and
  clock or numeric fields. Providers control their source permissions and expiry.
- Music uses the current title, artist, playing state and optional artwork.
- The optional Notifications activity uses the app identity, sender/title,
  optional message text and optional icon. Notification access is controlled
  by Pebble and must be allowed explicitly. Notifications defaults to Off and
  follows the same primary/secondary order as other activities.
- Phone battery and connection state support the optional status indicators.

Music requires Pebble's `ReadMusic` permission. Notification sources require
notification access; location-based readings may require location access.
Pebble controls those permissions and the selected providers.

## Storage and display choices

The bundled phone configuration page reads and saves preferences through
Pebble's configuration bridge. A verified Save keeps the page open; an offline
watch may still be waiting for delivery. Stable provider ordering is stored
with the existing Clay preference record so a Save uses one confirmed snapshot.
Older separate ordering records remain readable. Neither the configuration
handler nor its storage contains live activity instances or notification text.

The navigation source and settings handler share the bundled plugin, with
settings code deferred until a configuration request. A navigation read does
not start an activity host, source subscription or settings page.

Appearance settings, delivery state and selected app names are stored locally
on the phone. Dynamic also saves stable activity-provider identifiers, order and
visibility flags in its own phone settings; it never saves activity content or
run identifiers in that preference list. Other apps keep their own order.
Appearance settings and bounded reading caches are also stored
on the watch. Selected readings other than music and notifications may remain
cached for up to two hours from confirmed receipt, capped by an earlier source
expiry; restoring a cache does not renew it.

Music and notification contents remain transient. Dynamic does not persist or
log their text or artwork. They clear on expiry, disconnection or relevant
privacy changes. Notification history is used to establish a baseline, so it
is not replayed when the face starts or reconnects.

App-only privacy keeps sender and message text out of watch activity packets.
Summary privacy omits the message body. These choices keep the same layout
selection and destination app. Pebble's phone-side notification reader still
needs notification access, and Dynamic can examine an update locally to tell it
from an unchanged notification. The app-name filter controls which notification
activities Dynamic displays; it does not replace Pebble's permission controls
or system notification settings.

Generic activities stay in transient consumer memory, including after reconnect.
A known public Timer clock may remain a bounded prediction only through its original
validity; private content clears on disconnection. The separate reference timer
plugin stores a bounded non-private timer snapshot on the phone. Dynamic does
not own or read the timer watchapp's native storage.

## Recent activity navigation

The Open Activity integration retains one overwritten routing record on the
phone: up to two destination watchapp UUIDs, a native session, presentation/view
sequence numbers and timestamps. It has at most 45 seconds of validity, capped
by source or role expiry. Only an explicitly confirmed native presentation can
renew it. Reading the plugin source does not renew it. Expired or invalid records
are removed on access; expiry is a validity boundary, not a promise of immediate
physical deletion while no code is running.

This metadata can reveal which apps were recently associated with displayed
activities. It contains no activity provider/occurrence IDs, title, artist,
notification body, timer name, artwork, action arguments or content fingerprint.
There is no routing history. The navigation source is read-only to consumers.
Dynamic's display content remains transient under the policies above.

## Other software and support

Your chosen plugins and the Pebble app have their own data handling. This
document describes Dynamic, not those services. Dynamic's settings page is
bundled in the PBW and does not need an external configuration website.
